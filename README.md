## ‚ú® Hi there!

Welcome to the repository of Animo's OpenID4VC Playground. This interactive playground demonstrates the use of OpenID4VC with different credential formats (such as SD-JWT VCs). This demo is built using [Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript). AFJ is a framework written in TypeScript for building decentralized identity services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v18.X.X - Other versions may work, not tested
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - You probably already have this

### üñ• App

Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env.local` file and set the environment variables. **This is not needed for development**.

```bash
cd app
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Used in the frontend application to connect with the backend. Default to `http://localhost:3001` for development. |

### üéõÔ∏è Agent

Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env.local` file and set the environment variables. **This is not needed for development**.

```bash
cd agent
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable           | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENT_HOST`       | Used in the backend application for the agent. The url at which the server will be available. |
| `AGENT_WALLET_KEY` | Used in the backend application for the agent. Should be secure and kept private.             |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> to use `ngrok` (`npx ngrok http 3001`) and use that url as the `AGENT_HOST` variable. Make sure to also set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable in the app to the ngrok.
>
> We may add issuance using did:key in development if the host url does not start with `https`.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Open three terminal windows, and then run the following:

```bash
npx ngrok http 3001
```

Copy the https url from the ngrok command and set that as the `AGENT_HOST`

```bash
cd agent
AGENT_HOST=https://30f9-58-136-114-148.ngrok-free.app pnpm dev
```

```bash
cd app
pnpm dev
```
